    <h1>Triple Triad</h1>
    <h3>How to play : </h3>

    <p>Triple Triad is played on a three-by-three (3x3) square grid of blank spaces where the cards will be placed. Each
      card has four numbers (known as ranks) placed in top left corner; each number corresponds to one of the four sides
      of the card. The ranks range from one to nine, the letter A representing ten.
      <br>
      In a basic game each player has five cards. Blue start the game. After the first card is played, the opponent may
      play a card on any unoccupied space on the board. The game continues with players' turns alternating.
    </p>
      <h3>Winning : </h3>

      <p>To win, a majority of the total ten cards played (including the one card that is not placed on the board) must
        be of the player's card color. To capture a card, the active player places a card adjacent to the opponent's
        card. If the rank touching the opponent's card is higher, the opponent's card will be captured and flipped into
        the active player's color. A card can be placed on any open spot on the board. The player who goes second will
        have a card remaining in their hand and that card will count towards their ending score. Each player may play
        one card per turn.</p>
